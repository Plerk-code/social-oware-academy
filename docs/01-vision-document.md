---

## 🚀 Development Philosophy

### Core Principles:
1. **Ship First** - Prototype with Unity primitives, polish after validation
2. **Playcentric Design** - Prototype → Test → Iterate → Repeat
3. **MVF over MVP** - Minimum Viable Fun > Minimum Viable Product
4. **Retention over Acquisition** - Duolingo proved retention has 5x impact on growth
5. **Living Documentation** - This GDD evolves with the project

### Asset Strategy:
- **MVF/Prototype** - Unity primitives (cubes, spheres) to prove mechanics
- **Pre-Launch Polish** - Stunning visuals become critical before public release
- **Post-Launch** - Continuous art improvements, cultural cosmetics

---

## 📅 Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: MVF Development (Months 1-4)
- Core gameplay loop with primitives
- Multiplayer infrastructure (Photon)
- Backend integration (PlayFab)
- Tutorial system (5 lessons)
- Basic UI/UX

### Phase 2: Pre-Launch Polish (Months 5-6)
- Stunning visual overhaul
- Audio/music implementation
- Onboarding optimization
- Performance tuning
- Beta testing (closed group)

### Phase 3: Soft Launch (Month 7)
- Limited geographic release (test markets)
- Monitor metrics (retention, conversion, virality)
- Iterate based on data
- Prepare marketing materials

### Phase 4: Global Launch (Month 8+)
- App Store & Google Play worldwide release
- Web version launch
- PR campaign (gaming press, cultural media)
- Influencer partnerships (TikTok, YouTube)
- Organic growth via viral loops

### Phase 5: Live Operations
- Weekly content updates (puzzles, lessons)
- Monthly feature releases (tournaments, clubs)

---

## 🎯 Competitive Advantages

1. **First-Mover** - No modern Oware app with social/learning features
2. **Cultural Authenticity** - Partnering with African gaming communities
3. **Modern Tech Stack** - Unity + Photon + PlayFab = scalable
4. **Proven Models** - Chess.com + Duolingo playbooks validated
5. **Cross-Platform** - Play anywhere, account syncs everywhere
6. **Ages 7-77** - Broad appeal (family play + competitive depth)

---

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Oware unknown in Western markets
**Mitigation:** Position as "ancient strategy game" like chess, emphasize learning curve is gentle, cultural storytelling creates intrigue

### Risk: Multiplayer complexity delays launch
**Mitigation:** Use Photon (proven middleware), focus on turn-based (simpler than real-time), defer tournaments to post-launch

### Risk: Premium conversion rate too low
**Mitigation:** Generous free tier drives volume, 7-day free trial reduces friction, paywall at high-value moments

### Risk: Moderation challenges (ages 7+)
**Mitigation:** No free text chat at launch (preset emotes only), private lobbies for families, clubs post-launch with moderation tools

### Risk: Asset quality doesn't match "stunningly beautiful" vision
**Mitigation:** Prototype-first validates fun, then invest in art, Asset Store for polish elements, hire freelancers for key assets
