## 💰 Revenue Model Overview

**Primary Model:** Freemium with Premium Subscription (Chess.com model)
**Future Expansion:** Battle Pass (V2.0)

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)

**Assumptions:**
- Month 6: 10,000 MAU (Monthly Active Users)
- Premium conversion rate: 3% (industry average: 2-5%)
- Average subscription: 70% monthly, 30% yearly

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) at 10K MAU:**
```
10,000 MAU × 3% conversion = 300 Premium subscribers

Monthly subscribers: 300 × 70% = 210 × $6.99 = $1,467.90
Yearly subscribers: 300 × 30% = 90 × $4.99/mo = $449.10
(yearly = $59.99/year = $4.99/mo equivalent)

Total MRR: ~$1,917
Annual Run Rate (ARR): ~$23,000
```

**Revenue Growth Targets:**
- Month 6: $2K MRR (10K MAU)
- Month 12: $10K MRR (50K MAU, improved conversion)
- Month 18: $30K MRR (150K MAU + Battle Pass launch)
- Year 2: $100K+ MRR (500K+ MAU, mature product)

## 🎯 Pricing Strategy

### Premium Subscription Tiers

#### Option 1: Single Tier (Recommended for MVF)

**PREMIUM - $6.99/month or $59.99/year**

**Benefits:**
✅ **Ad-Free Experience** - No interstitial ads between matches
✅ **2x XP Multiplier** - Level up twice as fast
✅ **2 Streak Freezes/Month** - Protect your streak from breaks
✅ **Advanced AI Opponent** - Challenge yourself with expert AI
✅ **Advanced Lessons (11-15)** - Unlock 5 additional strategy lessons
✅ **Puzzle Archive** - Access past 365 days of daily puzzles
✅ **Priority Matchmaking** - Faster queue times in ranked
✅ **Premium Badge** - Exclusive badge on your profile
✅ **7-Day Free Trial** - First-time subscribers only

**Pricing Rationale:**
- **$6.99/month:** Matches Duolingo Super, slightly below Chess.com Platinum ($7.99)
- **$59.99/year:** 30% savings ($71.88 value) = strong conversion incentive
- **Competitive positioning:** Premium but accessible (not luxury pricing)

---

#### Option 2: Multi-Tier (Future Consideration - V2.0+)

**If single tier underperforms, consider:**

**PREMIUM BASIC - $4.99/month or $39.99/year**
- Ad-free
- 1.5x XP multiplier
- 1 streak freeze/month
- Advanced AI

**PREMIUM PLUS - $9.99/month or $79.99/year**
- Everything in Basic
- 3x XP multiplier
- 3 streak freezes/month
- Advanced lessons
- Puzzle archive

**Decision Point:** Launch with single tier, monitor conversion rate. If <2%, consider tiered approach.

## 🎣 Paywall Strategy

### Paywall Timing (Contextual Triggers)

**1. Value Moment: After Completing Free Lessons**
- **Trigger:** Player completes Lesson 5 (last free lesson)
- **Context:** They've enjoyed learning, want more
- **Paywall Message:**
  - **Headline:** "Ready for Advanced Strategy?"
  - **Body:** "Unlock 10 more lessons with Premium. Master Oware like a pro!"
  - **CTA:** "Start 7-Day Free Trial"
  - **Dismissible:** Yes

**2. Pain Point: After 3rd Ad View**
- **Trigger:** Free player sees 3rd interstitial ad
- **Context:** Ads are annoying, they're engaged enough to see 3
- **Paywall Message:**
  - **Headline:** "Tired of Ads?"
  - **Body:** "Go ad-free with Premium. Plus get 2x XP and advanced lessons!"
  - **CTA:** "Try Premium Free for 7 Days"
  - **Dismissible:** Yes (X button)

**3. Loss Aversion: When Streak Breaks**
- **Trigger:** Player opens app, sees streak reset to 0
- **Context:** They feel loss, want to prevent future breaks
- **Paywall Message:**
  - **Headline:** "Never Lose Your Streak Again"
  - **Body:** "Premium includes 2 automatic streak freezes per month!"
  - **CTA:** "Protect My Streak"
  - **Dismissible:** Yes

**4. Achievement Moment: After Reaching Level 10**
- **Trigger:** Player levels up to Level 10
- **Context:** They're invested, feel proud, want to progress faster
- **Paywall Message:**
  - **Headline:** "You're Leveling Up Fast! 🎉"
  - **Body:** "Premium gives you 2x XP. Reach Level 20 in half the time!"
  - **CTA:** "Accelerate My Progress"
  - **Dismissible:** Yes

**5. Competitive Pain: After Losing 3 Ranked Matches**
- **Trigger:** Player loses 3 ranked matches in a row
- **Context:** They want to improve, need better tools
- **Paywall Message:**
  - **Headline:** "Learn from the Pros"
  - **Body:** "Premium unlocks advanced strategy lessons and expert AI practice!"
  - **CTA:** "Improve My Game"
  - **Dismissible:** Yes

**6. Social Incentive: When Creating 4th Private Lobby**
- **Trigger:** Free player tries to create 4th lobby (limit is 3)
- **Context:** They're social, want to play with more friends
- **Paywall Message:**
  - **Headline:** "Unlock Unlimited Lobbies"
  - **Body:** "Premium lets you create as many private lobbies as you want!"
  - **CTA:** "Upgrade to Premium"
  - **Dismissible:** No (must dismiss or upgrade, or delete old lobby)

---

### Paywall Design Principles

**DO:**
- ✅ Show value, not just price ("Unlock 10 lessons" not "Pay $6.99")
- ✅ Contextualize timing (show when relevant, not random)
- ✅ Highlight free trial prominently ("7-Day Free Trial" bigger than price)
- ✅ Allow dismissal (no hard blocks on core gameplay)
- ✅ Use loss aversion (streaks, competitive features)
- ✅ A/B test messaging, visuals, CTA wording

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Block core gameplay (matches, ranked play stay free)
- ❌ Use dark patterns (fake scarcity, hidden fees)
- ❌ Spam paywalls (max 1 per session, frequency cap)
- ❌ Shame free players ("You're missing out!" tone)
- ❌ Hide cancellation (clear subscription management)

## 📈 Conversion Optimization

### Onboarding to Premium Funnel

```
10,000 App Installs
    ↓ (70% complete tutorial)
7,000 Tutorial Completed
    ↓ (40% D7 retention)
2,800 Active D7
    ↓ (10% see paywall in first week)
280 Paywall Views
    ↓ (15% click "Start Trial")
42 Trial Starts
    ↓ (70% convert to paid after trial)
29 Paying Subscribers

Conversion Rate: 0.29% (29/10,000)
Target: 3% = need better funnel optimization
```

### Optimization Tactics

**1. Improve Onboarding (Goal: 70% → 85% tutorial completion)**
- Shorter tutorial (2 min instead of 3)
- Skip button for experienced players
- Immediate gratification (win first match guaranteed)

**2. Increase D7 Retention (Goal: 40% → 50%)**
- Better daily challenges (more variety)
- Streak mechanic emphasis (push notifications)
- Social hooks (invite friends for bonus XP)

**3. Increase Paywall Visibility (Goal: 10% → 25%)**
- Show paywall at optimal moments (contextual triggers)
- A/B test timing (after 2 ads vs. 3 ads)
- Non-intrusive banners ("Try Premium" in menu)

**4. Increase Trial Start Rate (Goal: 15% → 30%)**
- Emphasize "FREE" in CTA ("Start FREE Trial")
- Show benefits list with checkmarks (visual clarity)
- Social proof ("10,000 players upgraded this month")

**5. Increase Trial → Paid Conversion (Goal: 70% → 80%)**
- Send email reminders during trial ("3 days left!")
- Highlight value during trial (usage stats: "You've saved 2 hours with 2x XP!")
- Offer annual discount at end of trial ("Save 30% with yearly plan")

**Target Funnel (Optimized):**
```
10,000 Installs → 8,500 Tutorial → 4,250 D7 → 1,063 Paywall Views
→ 319 Trial Starts → 255 Paid Subscribers = 2.55% conversion ✅
```

## 💳 Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring Effect
- Show yearly price first (higher perceived value)
- "Save 30%" label on annual plan (loss aversion)
- Strikethrough original monthly equivalent: ~~$83.88~~ → $59.99/year

### Decoy Effect (Future Multi-Tier)
- If adding tiers, make middle tier most attractive
- Basic ($4.99), **Plus ($9.99 - "Most Popular")**, Pro ($14.99)
- Most users choose middle (Goldilocks effect)

### Free Trial Psychology
- "Start 7-Day Free Trial" (emphasize FREE)
- Avoid "No credit card required" (actually increases friction, studies show)
- During trial: "You're on Premium! Enjoying ad-free play?"

## 🎮 Battle Pass (V2.0 - Future)

### Structure
**Season Duration:** 3 months (4 seasons per year)
**Tiers:** 50 levels

**Free Track:**
- Cosmetics (basic)
- XP boosts (small)
- Currency (small amounts)

**Premium Track ($9.99/season or included with Premium subscription):**
- Exclusive cosmetics (board skins, avatars)
- Major XP boosts (50% bonus for season)
- Premium currency (for future shop)
- Early access to new features

### Progression
- Earn Battle Pass XP from all activities (matches, lessons, challenges)
- Tier 50 = "prestige" reward (ultra-rare cosmetic)
- FOMO: Season ends, rewards gone forever

### Revenue Model
- Separate purchase ($9.99) or included in Premium subscription (added value)
- Target: 10-15% of MAU purchase Battle Pass
- At 50K MAU: 5,000 buyers × $9.99 = $50K per season = $200K/year

## 🧪 A/B Testing Plan

### Test 1: Paywall Timing
- **Variant A:** After 2 ad views
- **Variant B:** After 3 ad views
- **Metric:** Trial start rate
- **Hypothesis:** Earlier paywall = higher frustration = higher conversion

### Test 2: Free Trial Length
- **Variant A:** 3-day trial
- **Variant B:** 7-day trial
- **Variant C:** 14-day trial
- **Metric:** Trial → Paid conversion
- **Hypothesis:** Longer trial = higher conversion (more value realization)

### Test 3: Pricing
- **Variant A:** $6.99/month
- **Variant B:** $7.99/month
- **Variant C:** $5.99/month
- **Metric:** Trial start rate + ARPU
- **Hypothesis:** Optimal price maximizes (conversion × price)

### Test 4: CTA Wording

- **Variant B:** "Try Premium Free"
- **Variant C:** "Unlock Premium Features"
- **Metric:** Paywall click-through rate
- **Hypothesis:** Emphasizing "FREE" increases clicks

## 🌍 Regional Pricing (Future Consideration)

**Problem:** $6.99/month is expensive in emerging markets (Nigeria, India, Brazil)

**Solution: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Pricing**
- Adjust price by region based on local purchasing power
- Example:
  - USA: $6.99/month
  - Nigeria: $2.99/month (NGN 1,200)
  - India: $2.49/month (INR 199)
  - Brazil: $3.99/month (BRL 20)

**Implementation:**
- Unity IAP supports regional pricing
- PlayFab tracks player country
- Set custom prices per App Store region

**Risk Mitigation:**
- VPN abuse (players in USA buying at Nigeria prices)
- Mitigation: Payment method verification (must match country)

## 🚫 What We WON'T Do (Ethical Monetization)

**No Pay-to-Win:**
- ❌ No buying ELO rating
- ❌ No "energy" systems (unlimited play for free)
- ❌ No gameplay advantages (Premium doesn't make you win)

**No Dark Patterns:**
- ❌ No fake timers ("Offer ends in 5 minutes!" when it doesn't)
- ❌ No hidden fees (all prices clear upfront)
- ❌ No difficult cancellation (one-tap unsubscribe)

**No Exploitative Tactics:**
- ❌ No loot boxes or gambling mechanics
- ❌ No preying on children (no purchases without parental consent flow)
- ❌ No aggressive retargeting (respect "No thanks" dismissals)

**Family-Friendly:**
- ✅ Transparent pricing
- ✅ Generous free tier (complete game for $0)
- ✅ Premium adds convenience, not victory
- ✅ Ages 7-77 means ethical monetization
